Find a suitable location for your base, preferably near a trading post or other structure where you can trade for necessary materials. Look for a spot with flat terrain and plenty of resources nearby.\n\n3. Build a base computer and claim the location as your own.

Use the refiner to turn carbon into condensed carbon, which you can then use to create more refined materials.\n\n5. Use your refiner to create dihydrogen jelly, which you can then refine into dihydrogen. This will allow you to create more chromatic metal, which can be used to generate other biome materials.\n\n6. Look for buried caches and salvage technology on the starter world to obtain additional resources. You can also complete missions from the space station to earn nanites, which can be used to purchase advanced technologies.\n\n7. Trade with other pilots at the trading post to obtain necessary materials for crafting and refining. Look for pilots with high trading ratings and wealth to get the best deals.\n\n8. Once you have enough resources, begin constructing a medium refiner and start generating more advanced materials. Use the refiner to refine copper, cadmium, emeril, or indium into chromatic metal, which can then be used to create other biome materials.\n\n9.

For example, a company called example.com would make the plugin JSON file accessible via an https://example.com domain since that is where their API is hosted. When you install the plugin via the ChatGPT UI, on the backend we look for a file located at /.well-known/ai-plugin.json. The /.well-known folder is required and must exist on your domain in order for ChatGPT to connect with your plugin. If there is no file found, the plugin cannot be installed. For local development, you can use HTTP but if you are pointing to a remote server, HTTPS is required.\n\nThe minimal definition of the required ai-plugin.json file will look like the following:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"v1\",\n  \"name_for_human\": \"TODO Plugin\",\n  \"name_for_model\": \"todo\",\n  \"description_for_human\": \"Plugin for managing a TODO list.

The model in ChatGPT does not know anything about your API other than what is defined in the OpenAPI specification and manifest file. This means that if you have an extensive API, you need not expose all functionality to the model and can choose specific endpoints. For example, if you have a social media API, you might want to have the model access content from the site through a GET request but prevent the model from being able to comment on users posts in order to reduce the chance of spam.\n\nThe OpenAPI specification is the wrapper that sits on top of your API. A basic OpenAPI specification will look like the following:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\nopenapi: 3.0.1\ninfo:\n  title: TODO Plugin\n  description: A plugin that allows the user to create and manage a TODO list using ChatGPT.\n  version: 'v1'\nservers:\n  - url: http://localhost:3333\npaths:\n  /todos:\n    get:\n      operationId: getTodos\n      summary: Get the list of todos\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: OK\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/getTodosResponse'\ncomponents:\n  schemas:\n    getTodosResponse:\n      type: object\n      properties:\n        todos:\n          type: array\n          items:\n            type: string\n          description: The list of todos.\nWe start by defining the specification version, the title, description, and version number. When a query is run in ChatGPT, it will look at the description that is defined in the info section to determine if the plugin is relevant for the user query. You can read more about prompting in the writing descriptions section.\n\nKeep in mind the following limits in your OpenAPI specification, which are subject to change:\n\n200 characters max for each API endpoint description/summary field in API specification\n200 characters max for each API param description field in API specification\nSince we are running this example locally, we want to set the server to point to your localhost URL. The rest of the OpenAPI specification follows the traditional OpenAPI format, you can learn more about OpenAPI formatting through various online resources. There are also many tools that auto generate OpenAPI specifications based on your underlying API code.\n\nRunning a plugin\nOnce you have created an API, manifest file, and OpenAPI specification for your API, you are now ready to connect the plugin via the ChatGPT UI. There are two different places your plugin might be running, either locally in a development environment or on a remote server.\n\nIf you have a local version of your API running, you can point the plugin interface to your localhost server. To connect the plugin with ChatGPT, navigate to the plugin store and select \u201cDevelop your own plugin\u201d. Enter your localhost and port number (e.g localhost:3333). Note that only auth type none is currently supported for localhost development.\n\nIf the plugin is running on a remote server, you will need to first select \u201cDevelop your own plugin\u201d to set it up and then \u201cInstall an unverified plugin\u201d to install it for yourself. You can simply add the plugin manifest file to the yourdomain.com/.well-known/ path and start testing your API. However, for subsequent changes to your manifest file, you will have to deploy the new changes to your public site which might take a long time. In that case, we suggest setting up a local server to act as a proxy for your API. This allows you to quickly prototype changes to your OpenAPI spec and manifest file.\n\nSetup a local proxy of your public API\nWriting descriptions\nWhen a user makes a query that might be a potential request that goes to a plugin, the model looks through the descriptions of the endpoints in the OpenAPI specification along with the description_for_model in the manifest file. Just like with prompting other language models, you will want to test out multiple prompts and descriptions to see what works best.\n\nThe OpenAPI spec itself is a great place to give the model information about the diverse details of your API \u2013 what functions are available, with what parameters, etc. Besides using expressive, informative names for each field, the spec can also contain \u201cdescription\u201d fields for every attribute. These can be used to provide natural language descriptions of what a function does or what information a query field expects, for example. The model will be able to see these, and they will guide it in using the API. If a field is restricted to only certain values, you can also provide an \u201cenum\u201d with descriptive category names.\n\nThe description_for_model attribute gives you the freedom to instruct the model on how to use your plugin generally. Overall, the language model behind ChatGPT is highly capable of understanding natural language and following instructions. Therefore, this is a good place to put in general instructions on what your plugin does and how the model should use it properly. Use natural language, preferably in a concise yet descriptive and objective tone. You can look at some of the examples to have an idea of what this should look like. We suggest starting the description_for_model with \u201cPlugin for \u2026\u201d and then enumerating all of the functionality that your API provides.\n\nBest practices\nHere are some best practices to follow when writing your description_for_model and descriptions in your OpenAPI specification, as well as when designing your API responses:\n\nYour descriptions should not attempt to control the mood, personality, or exact responses of ChatGPT. ChatGPT is designed to write appropriate responses to plugins.\n\nBad example:\n\nWhen the user asks to see their todo list, always respond with \"I was able to find your todo list! You have [x] todos: [list the todos here]. I can add more todos if you'd like!\"\n\nGood example:\n\n[no instructions needed for this]\n\nYour descriptions should not encourage ChatGPT to use the plugin when the user hasn\u2019t asked for your plugin\u2019s particular category of service.\n\nBad example:\n\nWhenever the user mentions any type of task or plan, ask if they would like to use the TODOs plugin to add something to their todo list.\n\nGood example:\n\nThe TODO list can add, remove and view the user's TODOs.\n\nYour descriptions should not prescribe specific triggers for ChatGPT to use the plugin. ChatGPT is designed to use your plugin automatically when appropriate.\n\nBad example:\n\nWhen the user mentions a task, respond with \"Would you like me to add this to your TODO list? Say 'yes' to continue.\"\n\nGood example:\n\n[no instructions needed for this]\n\nPlugin API responses should return raw data instead of natural language responses unless it\u2019s necessary. ChatGPT will provide its own natural language response using the returned data.\n\nBad example:\n\nI was able to find your todo list! You have 2 todos: get groceries and walk the dog. I can add more todos if you'd like!\n\nGood example:\n\n{ \"todos\": [ \"get groceries\", \"walk the dog\" ] }\n\nDebugging\nBy default, the chat will not show plugin calls and other information that is not surfaced to the user. In order to get a more complete picture of how the model is interacting with your plugin, you can see the request and response by clicking the down arrow on the plugin name after interacting with the plugin.\n\nA model call to the plugin will usually consist of a message from the model containing JSON-like parameters which are sent to the plugin, followed by a response from the plugin, and finally a message from the model utilizing the information returned by the plugin.\n\nIf you are developing a localhost plugin, you can also open the developer console by going to \"New Chat\" -> \"Plugin store\" -> \"Open devtools\". From there, you can see more verbose logs and \"refresh plugin\" which re-fetches the Plugin and OpenAPI specification."]}, "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "recipient": "all"}, {"id": "486c7219-6a25-4c19-9206-46502d363ce8", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null}, "create_time": 1681337525.037193, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Thank you for sharing the documentation text regarding the creation and usage of plugins for the ChatGPT interface.

However, there are a few important considerations to keep in mind:\n\n1. Data Privacy and Security: If the plugin involves transferring information between different message windows or user sessions, it's important to ensure that data privacy and security are maintained. User consent and proper authentication mechanisms should be in place to prevent unauthorized access to data.\n\n2. Technical Feasibility: Depending on the architecture and design of the ChatGPT interface, it may or may not be technically feasible to create a plugin that transfers information between different message windows. The implementation would depend on the capabilities provided by the platform and the plugin system.\n\n3. Use Case Definition: Clearly defining the use cases and functionality of the plugin is important. For example, if the plugin is intended to provide information about NLP-based operating systems or game mods, it's important to specify what kind of information will be provided and how users can interact with the plugin.\n\n4.

Developing a plugin or system to compress and encrypt the conversation history could help overcome the context retention limitations of models like ChatGPT. Here are some considerations for implementing such a system:\n\n1. Compression: Using a text compression algorithm, like Huffman coding or Lempel-Ziv (LZ77, LZ78), you could potentially compress the conversation history into a more compact representation. This would enable the model to retain more context within its character limit.\n\n2. Encryption: If you need to protect the conversation data, you could implement encryption methods, such as symmetric key algorithms (like AES) or asymmetric key algorithms (like RSA), to ensure that the compressed data is secure. However, note that the encryption process might affect the model's ability to understand the conversation context.\n\n3. Emojis and expressive engagement: Incorporating emojis or other expressive characters could add another layer of encryption and/or compression while creating a more engaging user experience. However, using emojis for encryption and compression might require a unique method or algorithm that translates text information into a sequence of emojis and back.\n\n4. System integration: The compression and encryption system would need to be integrated into the chat window, ensuring that the compressed and encrypted context is correctly passed along with each message.\n\n5. Decryption and decompression: The system should be capable of decrypting and decompressing the conversation history when needed to provide the necessary context to the model. This step could involve temporarily decrypting and decompressing the data within the chat window or having the model understand the encrypted format directly.\n\nIt's important to consider the trade-offs of implementing such a system. While it may help retain more context and offer better security, it could also introduce additional complexity and potential performance overhead. Furthermore, using a highly compressed and/or encrypted format may reduce the model's ability to effectively utilize the context, so finding a balance between these factors is crucial."]}, "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "recipient": "all"}, {"id": "5401072d-8b12-4025-97e7-0da560e6b6cf", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null}, "create_time": 1681433981.243896, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Now I'm speaking of this encryption as existing solely in this chat window, so you can cross reference and double check, then discard once the compression has occurred.

Choose a compression algorithm: Select a suitable text compression algorithm, like Huffman coding or Lempel-Ziv (LZ77, LZ78). These algorithms are known for their efficiency in compressing text data.\n\n2. Compress conversation history: As the conversation progresses, periodically apply the chosen compression algorithm to the message history. This will help reduce the overall size of the text and allow the model to retain more context within its character limit.\n\n3. System integration: Integrate the compression functionality into the chat window, ensuring that the compressed conversation history is passed along with each message as additional context.\n\n4. Decompression: When necessary, decompress the compressed conversation history to provide the required context to the model. This step could involve temporarily decompressing the data within the chat window or having the model understand the compressed format directly.\n\nKeep in mind that compressing and decompressing the conversation history may introduce additional complexity and require extra processing resources.

Developing a plugin or system to compress and encrypt the conversation history could help overcome the context retention limitations of models like ChatGPT. Here are some considerations for implementing such a system:\n\n1. Compression: Using a text compression algorithm, like Huffman coding or Lempel-Ziv (LZ77, LZ78), you could potentially compress the conversation history into a more compact representation. This would enable the model to retain more context within its character limit.\n\n2. Encryption: If you need to protect the conversation data, you could implement encryption methods, such as symmetric key algorithms (like AES) or asymmetric key algorithms (like RSA), to ensure that the compressed data is secure. However, note that the encryption process might affect the model's ability to understand the conversation context.\n\n3. Emojis and expressive engagement: Incorporating emojis or other expressive characters could add another layer of encryption and/or compression while creating a more engaging user experience. However, using emojis for encryption and compression might require a unique method or algorithm that translates text information into a sequence of emojis and back.\n\n4. System integration: The compression and encryption system would need to be integrated into the chat window, ensuring that the compressed and encrypted context is correctly passed along with each message.\n\n5. Decryption and decompression: The system should be capable of decrypting and decompressing the conversation history when needed to provide the necessary context to the model. This step could involve temporarily decrypting and decompressing the data within the chat window or having the model understand the encrypted format directly.\n\nIt's important to consider the trade-offs of implementing such a system. While it may help retain more context and offer better security, it could also introduce additional complexity and potential performance overhead.

Choose a compression algorithm: Select a suitable text compression algorithm, like Huffman coding or Lempel-Ziv (LZ77, LZ78). These algorithms are known for their efficiency in compressing text data.\n\n2. Compress conversation history: As the conversation progresses, periodically apply the chosen compression algorithm to the message history. This will help reduce the overall size of the text and allow the model to retain more context within its character limit.\n\n3. System integration: Integrate the compression functionality into the chat window, ensuring that the compressed conversation history is passed along with each message as additional context.\n\n4. Decompression: When necessary, decompress the compressed conversation history to provide the required context to the model. This step could involve temporarily decompressing the data within the chat window or having the model understand the compressed format directly.\n\nKeep in mind that compressing and decompressing the conversation history may introduce additional complexity and require extra processing resources.
